# Overview

In this challenge, you will learn about how to implement a new feature that gives all challenges a difficulty label. This will test your ability to ensure software security by not breaking the existing functionality of the Challenge class when implementing the label. 

Drawn from User Story 15.

## Scenario

You are a junior software developer working at a startup company that is based around developing educational software. The team has already built out a prototype of the data structure that the Challenge class will maintain. You have been tasked with expanding the structure, adding more functionality in the form of a "difficulty label" that all Challenge class objects will have. 

In this challenge, you will:
- Add difficulty attribute to the Challenge class
- Create a _validate_difficulty for check for invalid difficulty inputs
- Create a get_difficulty() 
- Modify get_summary() to include difficulty
